# Emily's notes

**Q1: what determines the host range of a pathogen?**

**Q2: what determines the community of pathogens found within a given host species?**

**H1: host species may inherit their pathogen communities from a common ancestor (inherited directly by descent).**
-sympatry, sequence data phylogeny

**H2: pathogens may expand their host range by infecting novel host species, which we term ‘host shifts’ (related hosts may share pathogens because of similar life histories, facilitating pathogen expansion over closely related hosts - indirect) **
-Rapid evolution within viral lineages allows host jumps across larger evolutionary distances 
-maybe look at sequencing data for this/speed of how they mutate

-phylogenetic pattern of pathogen sharing'

- half of the recorded helminth pathogens are specific to a single primate species WE SHOULD GET A BASELINE STAT FOR FUNGAL PATHOGENS

- direct (physical) and indirect (vectors) transmission classification of viruses


- Jaccard index ($\beta_j$) pathogen sharing as an index of community similarity, measuring the difference in pathogen species composition between 2+ host species
$$\beta_j = \frac{a}{a+b+c}$$

Jaccard (1912),
- a is the number of pathogen species found on two host species, X and Y
- b is the number of pathogen species on host X that are not found on host Y
- c is the number of pathogen species on host Y that are not found on host X

- Proportion of target plant species that developed disease symptoms after inoculation with fungal pathogens from source plant species

- Host geographical range overlap index?

- regressed $\beta_j$ against host relatedness and one of the two measures of geographical overlap.

- construct super tree to get host relatedness?
